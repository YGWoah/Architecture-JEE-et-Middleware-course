This project is a Java-based application that serves as a homework assignment divided into two parts. It demonstrates the use of dependency injection and inversion of control (IoC) in a unique and educational way.

## Part 1

In the first part of the project, we explore dynamic dependency injection. This is a powerful technique that allows objects to be configured with dependencies at runtime, rather than at compile time. This provides a great deal of flexibility and can make your code more modular, reusable, and easy to test.

## Part 2

The second part of the project involves the creation of a custom mini-framework. This framework is designed to handle dependency injection using a configuration file. This approach allows for a high degree of customization and can make it easier to manage complex dependency graphs.
